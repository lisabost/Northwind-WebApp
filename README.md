<h1>PROJECT NOTES</h1>

I added an API controller class to the project to help us with fetching reviews for products. Im thinking this will make it look better when a customer adds a review and the page doesnt need to reload, it can just grab the update reviews using the api. - Jeff


11/10/21 I fixed the AddReview method in the product controller to actually add reviews when they are submitted from the modal. I think my brain is fried. -Lisa
