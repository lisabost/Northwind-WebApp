<h1>LOOK HERE GUYS!</h1>

Im thinking we should use an API to fetch the reviews for a given product when the ProductDetail.cshtml page is loaded. Im going to write a script that will load those reviews and display them in the accordion. Let me know if this will cause problems! You can just let me know by editing this!
