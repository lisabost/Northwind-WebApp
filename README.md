<h1>LOOK HERE GUYS!</h1>

Im thinking we should use an API to fetch the reviews for a given product when the ProductDetail.cshtml page is loaded. Im going to write a script that will load those reviews and display them in the accordion. Let me know if this will cause problems! You can just let me know by editing the README.md file in this repo!
